## SQL for Data Analysis

This project is part of Udacity Nano Degree Program and the data from a fictious paper company named Parch and Posey. Company have sales reps spread across the US in four regions and thier product line includes regular, poster and glossy papers. Their clients are primarily large Fortune 100 Companies. Using SQL, I will be able to help Parch and Posey to answer different questions by data analysis. 

- In the first part of the project project I used basic SQL commands includig SELECT, FROM, WHERE and corresponding logical operators.
- In the second part I used SQL joins to combine data tables and answer more complex business question. 
- In the third part, aggregation of data was done including COUNT,SUM,MIN and MAX funciton. I also used CASE and DATE functions and worked with Null Values.
